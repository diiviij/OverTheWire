cd inhere

#lets see whats inside inhere

ls

#alot of files labelled as " maybehere " but using ./* does not work. using find ./* 
#shows the files but only some have different aspects to them but we do not see what meets the requirement of this level.
#to run a specific search on the requirements of this level, 
#which is "human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable," we need to run a specific search
#multiple ways to look for the right file with those properties. 
#Most of the files are readable text but only one has 1033c. 
#You can use a code to find the 1033c either by "find -size 1033" 
#or you can look up the exact properties and include cat to read that file at the end 
#using " find . -type f -size 1033c -exec cat {} \;"

find . -type f -size 1033c -exec cat {} \;

#password gathered is " DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7 "
